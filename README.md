# tetris

Tetris is a puzzle game (see Wikipedia), whose subject is to contain falling pieces as long as possible in a Playground. The game is over when the field no longer offers enough room for a new piece to fall. When one or more lines of land are complete, they disappear, allowing to postpone the expiry of the game.

The game you are going to build is based on these basics but is played between several players.

Each player has his own playing field, all players undergo the same series of pieces. As soon as a player destroys lines on his ground, the opposing players receive n - 1 lines in penalty, then indestructible, which fit at the bottom of their playground.

A terrain consists of 10 columns and 20 lines. Each player can graphically observe the list of his opponents (name) and the specter of their land. For each column, a spectrum indicates the first line occupied by a piece without providing any details about occupation of the following lines. As soon as the terrain is updated, all opponents must visualize the evolution of their spectrum.

## moving the pieces

    Left and right arrows: Horizontal move to the right or left
    Top arrow: Rotation (only one direction is enough)
    Down arrow: Fall towards the pile
    Spacebar: Vertical move to position a piece in a hole in the pile

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
